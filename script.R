## Exercise 1
# Use filter() to find the number of districts with a 100% Algebra I proficiency rate.
#
filter(ach_profile, AlgI==100)


# mutate(ach_profile, if_else(Enrollment>= 1000, "Large","Small"))
# mutate(ach_profile, district_size = if_else(Enrollment>= 10000, "Large","NA_character_")
# district_size = if_else(Enrollment>= 5000, "medium",district_size)
# )
# the second one overrides 1st one in if_else but case when does not over_ride


## Exercise 2
# Create a new variable called `math_achievement` with a value of:
#     * `"High"` if a district's Math proficiency is 75% or higher;
#     * `"Medium"` if a district's Math proficiency is between 50% and 75%;
#     * `"Low"` if a district's Math proficiency is below 50%.
mutate(ach_profile, math_achievement=case_when(Math >75 ~ 'High',
                                               Math >= 50 ~ 'Medium',
                                               Math < 50 ~ 'Low',
                                               TRUE ~ 'No Data')

## Exercise 3
# Filter down to district 792 (Shelby County), then pipe the result to `View()`.
filter(ach_profile, system == 792) %>% View()


## Exercise 4
# Do the following in one sequence of function calls, piped together:
# 1. Read in the `data/tvaas.csv` file.
# 2. Rename variables as follows:
#     * `District Name` to `system`.
#     * `District-Wide: Composite` to `TVAAS Composite`.
#     * `District-Wide: Literacy` to `TVAAS Literacy`.
#     * `District-Wide: Numeracy` to `TVAAS Numeracy`.
# 3. Drop the `District Name` variable.

tvaas <- read_csv('data/tvaas.csv') %>%
    rename(system ='District Number',
           'TVAAS Composite' = 'District-Wide: Composite',
           'TVAAS Numeracy' = 'District-Wide: Numeracy') %>%
    select(-`District Name`)

View(tvaas)


## Exercise 5
# Sort alphabetically by CORE region, then by Algebra I proficiency in descending order.
# Then, keep just the district name, Algebra I proficiency, and CORE region variables.

ach_profile %>%
    arrange(CORE_region, desc(AlgI)) %>%
    select(system_name, AlgI, CORE_region)

## Exercise 6
# Use `summarise()` to find the mean, minimum, and maximum district grad rate.
# Assign variable names to the resulting data frame.
ach_profile %>%
    filter(system_name != "State of Tennessee") %>%
    summarise(mean_grad = mean(Graduation, na.rm = TRUE),
              min_grad = min(Graduation, na.rm = TRUE),
              max_grad = max(Graduation, na.rm = TRUE))

## Exercise 7
# Identify districts with a higher Percent ED than the median district, and a
# higher Math proficiency than the median district.

ach_profile %>%
    filter(Math > median(Math,na.rm = TRUE),
           Pct_ED > median(Pct_ED,na.rm = TRUE)) %>%  View()

# Exercise 8
# Identify districts with a higher dropout rate than the average of districts
# in the same CORE Region.

ach_profile %>%
    group_by(CORE_region) %>%
    filter(Dropout > mean(Dropout, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    View()


## Exercise 9
# Calculate three variables:
# * A district's average proficiency in math subjects (Math, Algebra I-II)
# * A district's average proficiency in English subjects (ELA, English I-III)
# * A district's average proficiency in science subjects (Science, Biology I, Chemistry)
# Then, reorder variables such that:
# * The math average is next to the individual math variables.
# * The English average is next to the individual English variables.
# * The science average is next to the individual science variables.

ach_profile %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    mutate(Math_avg = mean(c(Math, AlgI, AlgII), na.rm = TRUE),
           Eng_avg = mean(c(ELA, EngI, EngII, EngIII), na.ram = TRUE),
           Sc_avg = mean(c(Science,BioI,Chemistry), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    select(system, system_name, Math, AlgI, AlgII, Math_avg,
           ELA, EngI, EngII, EngIII, Eng_avg, Science, BioI, Chemistry, Sc_avg) %>%
    View()

## Exercise 10
# Create a data frame with the number of districts at each TVAAS level, by CORE region.
ach_profile %>%
    inner_join(tvaas, by = "system") %>%
    group_by(CORE_region,`TVAAS Composite`) %>%
    count() %>%
    View()


## Exercise 11
# Reshape the `tvaas` data frame long by subject, then arrange by system.

tvaas %>%
    gather(subject, level, `TVAAS Composite`:`TVAAS Numeracy`) %>%
    arrange(system) %>% View()
